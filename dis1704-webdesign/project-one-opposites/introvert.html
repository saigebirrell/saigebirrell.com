<!-- information -->
<p class="introinfo">
People who are introverted tend to be inward turning, or focused more on internal thoughts, feelings and moods rather than seeking out external stimulation. Introverts tend to be more quiet, reserved, and introspective and find they have to expend energy in social situations. After attending a party or spending time in a large group of people, introverts often feel a need to recharge by spending a period of time alone. While introverts may be judged for their lack of participation, they’ll hardly ever be accused of being obnoxious, needy, and disruptive. Because introverts value their space, they tend to naturally respect that of others. Since introverts give less attention to socializing than extroverts, they devote more attention to other things. They have the ability to cloister themselves away from the rest of the world and bunker down to accomplish a task or objective. Introverts are naturally adept when it comes to actively listening and prefer to process information internally, which allows them to hear, understand and provide carefully considered insight when they do respond. Introverts are also independent. Whenever possible, they prefer to work independently, and they require less supervision than most extroverts. They tend to have their own preferences that are less influenced by trends, and may gravitate towards things that are obscure, unusual, or downright strange. Introverts prefer quality of relationships over quantity and choose their friends wisely. They would rather have a few close, trusted friendships to invest their time and energy in. In relationships, introverts crave personal space to reflect and refuel, and they can sense when their partners need space, too. They like to get to know someone before sharing intimate details with a prospective partner. Introverts are there to listen and support their partner without feeling compelled to talk about themselves. Introverts can also make the best leaders, as they have focused conversations with their team members in order to learn their skills, passions and strengths. They don’t feel the need to step into the spotlight and take all of the credit for group successes.
