Extroverts are often described as the life of the party. Their outgoing, vibrant nature draws people to them, and they have a hard time turning away the attention. They thrive off the interaction. An extrovert feels the need to be among other people all (or at least most) of the time, which means that they will always be socially active. They will always be in contact with new people and offer them new opportunities to experience new things in life. Extroverts are rarely bored. This makes it likely that your weeknights and weekends are stacked with plans or activities that allow you to get that instant experience high. An extrovert can express their feelings easily. Extroverts are known for speaking their minds. This means you divulge your feelings rather than keeping them bottled up. Extroverts love to solve problems face to face and discuss the issues and various options with others. Talking about it helps you explore the issue in depth and figure out which option might work the best. It promotes fast growth for the individual. An extrovert is likely to develop in his professional life much quicker than those who are reserved and shy, as they can impress other people easily with confidence. You're not afraid to put in the work or talk to the right people to make your goals happen. Extroverts are wired for enthusiasm. That's because they are more likely to associate pleasurable feelings with their current environment. Extroverts have an outgoing nature, which makes it easy to make friends. You're likely the one talking to everyone at the party or getting to know your new co-worker on her first day.
